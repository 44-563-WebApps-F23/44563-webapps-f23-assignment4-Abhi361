           <p><span class="direction"> [Turns his head, and says in an off-hand tone of indifference:] </span>, is
              that you?</p>


              <h6 class="name kaia">KAIA</h6>

              <p>I merely wished to let you know that I have come.</p>


              <h6 class="name solness">SOLNESS</h6>

             <p>Yes, yes, that's all right. Hasn't Ragnar come too?</p>


              <h6 class="name kaia">KAIA</h6>

                <p>No, not yet. He had to wait a little while to see the doctor. But he is
                coming presently to hear--</p>


                <h6 class="name solness">SOLNESS</h6>

          <p>How is the old man to-day?</p>


          <h6 class="name kaia">KAIA</h6>

          <p>Not well. He begs you to excuse him; he is obliged to keep his bed
           to-day.</p>


           <h6 class="name solness">SOLNESS</h6>

           <p>Why, of course; by all means let him rest. But now, get to your work.</p>


           <h6 class="name kaia">KAIA</h6>

           <p>Yes. <span class="direction">[Pauses at the door.] </span> you wish to speak to Ragnar when he comes?</p>


           <h6 class="name solness">SOLNESS</h6>

            <p>No--I don't know that I have anything particular to say to him.</p>

            <p><span class="direction">[KAIA goes out again to the left.  SOLNESS remains seated,
             turning over the drawings.]</span></p>
